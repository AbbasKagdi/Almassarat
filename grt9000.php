      <p class="text-left ">GRT 9000 is available as a clear or opaque polymer. Both varieties are high performing stabilization agents that work by physically and chemically bonding soil or pavement particles leading to improved compressive strengths, high tensile resilience, and water impermeability.</p>

      <h5 class="orange">Overview:</h5>
      <p>Inadequate pavements (due pavement life or increased traffic volumes) can result in considerable and detrimental effects for an asset owner or manager’s triple bottom line. Dust, potholes, rutting, corrugation and other surface degradation caused by heavy traffic or extreme weather can cause serious harm to people, the planet and profit.</p>
      <p>GRT 9000 polymer soil stabilization helps alleviate these environmental, social and financial concerns. Using in-situ or imported materials, GRT 9000 is used to create a hard, semi-flexible and water impermeable pavement. Mitigating against pavement and surface degradation, GRT 9000 is designed to treat:</p>
      <ul class="" style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Natural or manufactured granular pavement materials</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Insitu recycled pavements</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Subgrade materials such as clays, silts and sands</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-5">GRT 9000 polymer soil stabilized pavements display high bearing and tensile resistance, and pose a cost effective alternative to traditional bound pavements such as asphalt and concrete – for a laid pavement saving from 50-70%. This polymer treated pavement can be used to design and construct:</p>
      <ul class="" style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Haul roads</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Rural and farming roads</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Service roads and hardstands</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Base and sub-base layers of major public roads and infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">Independently verified as environmentally sustainable, GRT 9000 can also be used to improve the performance of traditional cementitious stabilising agents. This can reduce the quantity of cement or lime required in pavement designs, or completely replace them.</p>
      <p class="small">Compared to conventional roads, GRT 9000 polymer soil stabilization drastically reduces material and haulage costs, construction time and your project’s carbon footprint – especially in remote areas. This makes GRT 9000 roads greener, cheaper and longer lasting.</p>
