            <span class="orange">GRT – DAMSEALER</span>
            <p>Ideal for the agricultural and resource sectors, this granular product is a specifically formulated, complex matrix of soluble and insoluble polymers at the forefront of dam repair technology.</p>
            
            <span class="orange">FIX LEAKING DAMS WITHOUT EXPENSIVE EARTHWORKS</span>
            <p class="text-secondary">Traditionally fixing a leaking dam required expensive civil works intervention – draining dams, relining with expensive imported clay or plastic liners.</p>
            <p><b>GRT DamSealer</b> avoids all this and can solve your leaking storage dam or retention/treatment facility for a fraction of the time and cost. A unique combination of polymers in a granular form, the product is broadcast over the water surface and simply floats to the bottom and sides of the dam, where it goes to work.</p>

            <span class="orange">GRT: DamSealer works in 2 ways</span>
            <ol>
                <li>Leaks and fissures cause small currents of water, which draw the larger granules in – these quickly expand to many times their size and plug these holes.</li>
                <li>A complex matrix of polymers then forms a thick, gel layer, sealing the entire surface it is in contact with. This effectively relines the treated surface with a durable waterproof coating 25 to 50mm thick.</li>
            </ol>    
                
            <span class="orange">Common Applications</span>
            <p>100grams per square metre of GRT: DamSealer is all that is required to plug leaks and integrate with the soil surface, preventing the loss of water in applications such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stock and irrigation dams</li>
                <li>“Turkey Nest” dams holding process or contaminated water</li>
                <li>Mining related dams</li>
                <li>Water retention basins in the civil industry</li>
                <li>Compensating for poor local materials or porous substrates when constructing new dams</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="bg-light p-2">Unlike other treatments in the marketplace, GRT-DamSealer is non-aquatoxic so can be used in sensitive environments or even for aquaculture.</div>

            <span class="orange">Water Clarification Range: CREATING CLEANER & SAFER WATER FROM DIRTY RUNOFF</span>
            <p class="text-secondary">GRT has three concentrate products that are safe and easy to handle, fast acting, and cost effective:</p>
            
            <p><b>GRT: CC</b> is a Concentrated Coagulant, used to clarify water contaminated with finely suspended clays in dams and sedimentation basins. It is also used for removal of nutrients such as phosphate from water and fluoride from industrial wastewater. Works well in conjunction with GRT: Liquid-Floc.</p>

            <p><b>GRT: Liquid-Floc</b> is a premium flocculation product utilising long-chain polymer (LCP) technology to clarify water by capturing suspended particles and dropping them out of suspension.</p>

            <p><b>GRT: Floc-Bloc</b> is a solidified flocculation agent simply placed on the inlets to sediment basins or outlets to watercourses to allow the clarification of water through flocculation.</p>

            <p class="bg-light p-2">GRT Water Clarification Products combine suspended contaminants in the water to form a complex interconnected structure. As the particles connect, they become heavier and settle out of suspension.</p>
            
            <p>Used in line with our application instructions, GRT: Water Clarification Products are safe and can be applied in the most environmentally sensitive areas.</p>

            <span class="orange">Common Applications:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Sediment Basins</li>
                <li>Water Storage Dams</li>
                <li>Any contained receiving waters</li>
