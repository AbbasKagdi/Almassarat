    <p class="lead">Works with dust so you don’t have to!</p>
    <p>GRT Haul-Loc is a specially formulated liquid polymer added to watering trucks used to reduce water required for continuous dust suppression by at least 65% and extend the dust suppressing effects four to five times longer than water alone.</p>

      <p class="text-left ">Designed specifically for the conditions of the mining and resource sectors, GRT: Haul-Loc is designed to be applied using existing site water trucks, tankers, or sprinklers. Mixed with water, GRT: Haul-Loc is sprayed onto road surfaces binding fine dust particles and preventing them from becoming airborne dust.</p>

      <h5 class="orange lead">We’ve Got Dust Covered</h5>
      <p>Left untreated, dust from unsealed haul roads, hardstands, cleared sites, and large soil/mineral stockpiles can have a considerable impact on staﬀ, the environment and the quality of life for local communities.</p>
      <p>GRT: Haul-Loc minimises this impact by locking down dust, as well as providing budget savings in the reduction of water truck movements – also reducing the potential for incidents by reducing traffic volumes. The use of GRT: Haul-Loc also eliminated the impact of overwatering for dust control leading to haul roads with improved surface integrity.</p>
      <p>GRT will work with you to devise a full dust mitigations strategy to meet the challenges facing your project or business operation. We can also provide engineering input to design, layout, and maintenance of your site roads as well as opportunities to optimise available materials for construction.</p>
