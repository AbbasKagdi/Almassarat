  <p class="text-left">UltraTecno Automatic Cleaning Machines have been specially designed and built to eliminate high amounts of adherent dirt.
    <br>We are ultrasonic cleaning machine manufacturers specialized in equipment from 100 up to 12,000 litres and in low-frequency equipment (25-28 kHz) with the highest cleaning power.  The 28 kHz cavitation frequency allows to generate bigger sized bubbles, releasing more power, increasing the cleaning effect, and therefore a better performance and a lower time cycle.
    <br><br>To select the appropriate model from our wide range of products, and to obtain better results, please respect the maximum workload of ultrasonic machines.  In order to improve performance of ultrasonic washer machines with a smooth dissemination of ultrasound, the distance of the load to the interior of the tank wall or the water surface must be of 10 cm as a minimum.
    <br><br>The parts must be separated during the ultrasonic cleaner machine treatment to allow the dissemination of ultrasound and the achievement of results.
    <br>The cleaning process lasts between 10 and 45 minutes, depending on the type and amount of dirt to be eliminated, the material of the parts, the cleaning product used, the loading capacity, and water temperature (which can be adjusted up to 90ºC).  The cleaning process is carried out automatically without requiring the presence of the operator.
