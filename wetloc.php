      <p class="text-left ">It is non-hazardous, environmentally friendly, water resistant, odourless, and effective immediately. It is safe for workers, livestock, produce and the surrounding environment. It can be applied through existing water trucks or farm sprayers, and ready to be trafficked immediately after application. It works by adsorbing onto the treated surface, making dust particles too heavy to become airborne, weighing them down like water, but without the threat of evaporation or freezing.</p>
