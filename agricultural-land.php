            <h5 class="" style="color:#ec7404;">Managing Your Dust</h5>
            <p class="">Managing dust on farms with GRT products is now the simple and effective way of reducing the risk of crop and fruit damage, respiratory disease, eye irritation, and product contamination on your farms.</p>
            <p class="">Airborne dust in its own right damages the upper and lower respiratory tracts of livestock – but is also the principle transport mechanism for the microbes that cause infection, illness, slowed gth and premature mortality in your stock.
                <br><span class="text-danger">Note: The rural workforce is also exposed to this same hazard!</span></p>
            <span class="orange">KEY AREAS OF DUST RELATED RISK ARE:</span>
            <ul class="" style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Eye and respiratory disease</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Discontented stock, damaged hoofs and even lameness</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Reduced crop yields</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Reduced effectiveness of spray coverage and the expected control of pests and diseases</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Wool contamination</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Reduced effectiveness of spray coverage and control of pests and diseases</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Blocked and contaminated water supplies and drainage channels</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Damage of crop transported through potholed, bumpy tracks and yards</li>
                <li><span class="orange">&#8594;</span> Machine operator safety and increased farm equipment maintenance costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="">GRT products have been developed to effectively eliminate dust generation by controlling the surface of gravel and soil based tracks and packing sheds without the expense of bitumen sealing, asphalt or concrete, the wasteful and overly short duration of water’s effectiveness, and the unreliability and detrimental impact of some other dust control products on the market.</p>
            <span class="orange">TESTED AND PROVEN PRODUCT OPTIONS</span>
            <p class=""><a href="wetloc.php" target="_blank" class="font-weight-bold">GRT Wet-Loc</a> and <a href="grt7000.php" target="_blank" class="font-weight-bold">GRT-7000</a>. These 2 products are tried and proven in the Australian and New Zealand rural sector and have been independently tested and verified to Food Safety Australia and New Zealand Standards (FSANZ).
                <br><br><a href="wetloc.php" target="_blank">GRT: Wet-Loc</a> is a clear, synthetic fluid that is applied neat. Formulated to meet the highest environmental standards, GRT: Wet-Loc is non-toxic and non-corrosive. It permeates deep into the finest of dust particles, weighing them down securely like water, but without the threat of evaporation or freezing to handle heavy wear and tight-turning areas such as:

                With correct dosage and application, it can remain actively effective for up to 12 months, regardless of the weather or severity of traffic.
                <br><br><a href="grt7000.php" target="_blank">GRT-7000</a> is a liquid polymer dust suppression concentrate for use on farm tracks and roads. GRT-7000 suppresses treated road dust particles for up to two months. It is mixed with water and can be applied using existing water trucks or tankers to provide an exceptional surface coating solution for farm access tracks.
                <br><br>It can also be mixed in to a depth of 50-100mm and act as a tough, long-term binding agent for track construction purposes.
