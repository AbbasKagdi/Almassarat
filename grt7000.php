      <h5 class="orange">GRT 7000 (D) Dust Control Polymer Sealing:</h5>
      <p>Polymer sealing with GRT 7000 works differently. After initial works, maintenance applications are required once every 12 to 16 week depending on traffic loading. With each application, an accumulating number of silty dust particles are bound together, preventing them from becoming airborne. Due to the cumulative residual nature of the product, over time, the rate of application of GRT 7000 reducing, becoming more economical each year. Simply sprayed from a water truck, the results are:</p>
      <ul class="" style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Elimination of dust and its impacts (visibility, health, surrounding areas)</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Stable, waterproof surface preventing corrugation and potholing</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Improved skid resistance and decreased rolling resistance</li>
        <li><span class="orange">&#8594; </span> Costs savings of 30-40% due to removal of daily watering and grading, less wear and tear on vehicles, improved haul times, elimination of downtime during and after wet weather (cost savings independently verified by Deloitte).</li>

      </ul>
      <h6 class="mt-5 orange lead">GRT 7000 (S) Soil Stabilization:</h6>
      <p>As well as a clear, environmentally safe, and aesthetically pleasing polymer seal, GRT 7000 is a highly effective polymer soil stabilization agent. Used on its own or in conjunction with traditional soil stabilisation agents it achieves extremely high UCS results with relatively low dosage rates. For example, testing with as little as 0.7% by mass has seen results over +6MPa achieved.</p>
